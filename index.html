    <h2>Rules for healthy life</h2>
    <p id="post"><i>Posted on  8 March , 2022</i></p>
    <p id="firstp">A healthy lifestyle is one which helps to keep and improve people's health and well-being and overcome lots of stress.Many governments and non-governmental organizations work in promoting healthy lifestyles.Healthy living is a lifelong effect. Being healthy includes healthy eating, physical activities, weight management, and stress management.</p>

    </br><p id="firstp">A healthy lifestyle includes a balanced diet. This does not mean cutting out important food groups of your diet or limiting yourself on the amount of calories per day. A well-rounded diet involves eating most food groups in every meal. Meats, dairy, fruits and vegetables are all important components of a meal that will ensure your body is healthy.</p>
    <ul id="list">
        <li> In nutrition, diet is the sum of food that is eaten by a person or another organism.A fad diet is a type of diet that becomes popular for a short time without any major health organizations recommending it.Health agencies recommend that people maintain a normal weight by limiting consumption of energy-dense foods and sugary drinks, eating plant-based food, limiting consumption of red and processed meat, and limiting alcohol intake.</li>
        <li> Exercises can be an important part of physical therapy, weight loss, or sports performance.Benefits of exercise for all ages have been known since antiquity. Marcus Cicero, around 65 BC, stated: “It is exercise alone that supports the spirits, and keeps the mind in vigor.”The CDC recommends that adults should get 150 minutes of physical activity weekly.Regular exercise has been shown to help high blood pressure, obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and depression, among others. Exercise also helps people feel less tired.</li>
        <li>Sleep is a state of resting, which happens in animals, including humans. During deep sleep, most of the muscles that animals can otherwise control are not active, but regain the energy for the next time they wake up. Animals during sleep are usually in an unconscious, relaxed state. Like most animals, healthy sleep in humans takes place at night.Sleep is extremely important to human health and well-being. Humans and animals need sleep in order for their bodies to be prepared for the next day. Everyday activities, one’s appearance, and how one expresses oneself all rely on this necessity.If one is tired (from not getting enough sleep), one will not be able to function properly in common activities. Being sleep-deprived leads to struggling to remember information, altering one’s mood, energy, health, focus and a number of other effects.</li>
        <li>Hygiene is the act of being clean. Washing the body to remove dirt and germs, brushing the teeth to keep them clean, shaving, using the toilet properly, and dressing correctly are some examples. Proper hygiene is often taught to children at a young age, and it becomes a habit. People who do not have good hygiene might smell bad, lose teeth, or become ill (sick).</li>
        <li>Addiction is when the body or mind badly wants or needs something in order to work right. When you have addiction to something it is called being addicted or being an addict. People can be addicted to drugs, cigarettes, alcohol, caffeine, and many other things.Addiction is similar to a major disease like chronic heart disease or perhaps diabetes, but addictions are not taken as seriously as these major diseases. Most people believe addiction to be a lifestyle choice, which in fact it is but it is also part of a person's genetics. While some people can do things and control themselves others cannot due to their genetic makeup. There are ways of helping the addict but this takes the admission of a problem and then proper testing to reveal what kind of treatment is needed.</li>
